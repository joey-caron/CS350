# CS350
A repository of work for my CS350 SNHU course

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I added artifacts from a couple of different projects, because I'm proud of both of them. The first is from a UART serial project, in which I needed to set up a Raspberry Pi with a solderless breadboard to have a UART serial connection with two programs running; a write program and a read program. The other was the final project, in which using the same Raspberry Pi and breadboard, I had to set up a thermostat prototype. It had a temperature sensor, and used a combination of buttons, LEDs and an LCD screen to read the current temperature, set the system to heat or cool mode, make a setpoint temperature and send the correct signals to the LEDs and LCD to show the user what the system was currently doing.

* What did you do particularly well?

With the UART project, I had a lot of difficulties. I couldn't get the system to connect, no matter what I tried. I spent over a week messing with the connections and configurations, trying to tweak the software, all to no avail. I finally decided it was most likely a bad serial cable, so I bought a new one. Sure enough that solved the problem. I feel it really showcases my problem solving skills. In the final project, most of the code needed to be written and wasn't simply provided for us. I also had some troubleshooting issues, where the LEDs weren't acting the way I was expecting, and I had a lot of fun trying to find the problem.

* Where could you improve?

I think I should have been able to find the issues faster. With the UART project, I should have just bought the new cable as soon as I started having issues, but instead I waited over a week hoping something else would be the solution. 

* What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I'm not sure I'll be adding much, as I already make use of Stack Overflow and Github when I have issues, and Google as a fallback. I feel like those work as well as anything.

* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I learned a lot about hardware in this course that I haven't in previous courses. Most of what I have learned in other courses throughout my SNHU career has been either syntax in various code languages, or else the development process such as the SDLC. Very little has been about how the hardware of a system works, so this will be handy to help troubleshoot issues I have in the future.

* How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

As with any other program, I added plenty of inline comments describing what each thing did unless it was extremely obvious what it was for. I also tried to keep variable names relatively generic so they wouldn't need to be changed in the case of someone else needing to reuse my code.
